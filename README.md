 [![Build Status] (http://travis-ci.org/MCME/EnforcerSuite.svg)] (http://travis-ci.org/MCME/EnforcerSuite)

As at some point I intend to finish this project, I am going to add a guide on how to use it on the wiki. All refences should be made there. Further more when this goes live, if there are problems feel free to submit an issue or a thread on the forums (I doubt you are even reading this because you have already done the latter)

Plugin that eases enforcer tasks

goals:
* Enforcer forum and archive
* auto logs
* simple image saver
* Auto OB demote/promote
* create secure TCP connections between build and the forums
* 

Setting up the zenforo (Really only for MCME devs):
* First install zenforo from a clean copy
* (ill add the rest when i have slept)
